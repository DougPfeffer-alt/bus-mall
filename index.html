    <h3>Welcome to BusMall, whose product is similar to the SkyMall catalog found in the seatback pockets on airplanes.
      The difference with BusMall is that instead of their catalog being placed in airplanes, they are placed on local
      busses while commuting through traffic.
      <br>
      <br>
      Since catalogs are expensive to print and distribute, and the products cost money to make and warehouse, and
      BusMall is a lean startup that needs to carefully watch its expenditures, BusMall wants to feature only the items
      in its catalog that are the most likely to sell.
      <br>
      <br>
      That is where you come in. BusMall needs your help to do market analysis on proposed products to test their
      potential customer interestâ€¦ before actually putting them into the catalog and getting the manufacturing wheels in
      motion.</h3>
